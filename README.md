# README

Here you can find the code to run the simulations that are reported in the article
"APPROXIMATING VOLUMETRIC SHAPE GRADIENTS FOR SHAPE OPTIMIZATION WITH CURVED BOUNDARIES CONSTRAINED BY PARABOLIC PDES"
by Leonardo Mutti and Prof. Dr. Michael Ulbrich.

## Getting started

To setup the code, perform the following instructions (on Linux):

- download the code and put in, say, the directory `ParabolicShapeGradientCode`,
- change the current directory: `cd ParabolicShapeGradientCode`,
- head now to `instructions/environment_setup.md` for instructions on how to set up your environment.

In the setup instructions, additional details on how to utilize the code are given (see especially `code/getting_started.md`).
